## ✅ Entry Criteria Checklist

### 1. Writing Templates Ready

- [ ] **Chapter template created** - Template in `4-utilities/templates/`
- [ ] **Template includes structure** - Beginning, middle, end sections
- [ ] **Template includes placeholders** - Clear guidance on what to write
- [ ] **Template tested** - Used for sample chapter, works well

**Why critical:** Templates ensure consistency and save time. Starting without a template leads to structural inconsistencies.

**How to verify:** Check `4-utilities/templates/chapter-template.md` exists and is complete.

---

### 2. AI Prompts Prepared

- [ ] **Chapter generation prompt** - Prompt for AI to draft chapters
- [ ] **Refinement prompt** - Prompt for improving chapter quality
- [ ] **Validation prompt** - Prompt for quality assessment
- [ ] **Consistency check prompt** - Prompt for continuity validation
- [ ] **Summary prompt** - Prompt for chapter summaries

**Why critical:** AI prompts enable AI-assisted writing. Without prompts, AI output is inconsistent and requires more manual work.

**How to verify:** Check `4-utilities/prompts/` has at least 3-5 core prompts documented.

---

### 3. Quality Frameworks in Place

- [ ] **Pass 2 NQ criteria defined** - 8 dimensions documented
- [ ] **Validation thresholds set** - ≥4.5/5.0 for publication quality
- [ ] **Validation process documented** - Know how to run validation
- [ ] **Quality frameworks tested** - Ran sample validation, understand output

**Why critical:** Quality frameworks enable objective assessment. Without them, quality is subjective and inconsistent.

**How to verify:** Check `3-preparation/quality-frameworks/` has validation criteria.

---

### 4. Chapter Structure Defined

- [ ] **Chapter outline complete** - All chapters listed with summaries
- [ ] **Chapter count set** - Know exactly how many chapters
- [ ] **Word count targets** - Know target words per chapter and total
- [ ] **Chapter dependencies** - Know chapter order and relationships

**Why critical:** Chapter structure provides roadmap. Without it, writing is aimless and requires significant restructuring.

**How to verify:** Check `3-preparation/blueprints/chapter-outline.md` exists and covers all chapters.

---

### 5. Writing Schedule Created

- [ ] **Timeline estimated** - Know how long Phase 5 will take
- [ ] **Milestones defined** - Act/section completion targets
- [ ] **Buffer time included** - Allocated extra time for unexpected delays
- [ ] **Commitment secured** - Have dedicated writing time (hours/week)

**Why critical:** Schedule provides accountability. Without timeline, Phase 5 drags indefinitely.

**How to verify:** Have written schedule with start/end dates and milestones.
