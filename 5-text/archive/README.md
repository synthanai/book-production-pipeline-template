# archive/

**Purpose:** Archive for old chapter versions and major revisions

---

## What Goes Here

- Previous versions of chapters after major revisions
- Alternative chapter approaches that were tried
- Deleted scenes worth keeping for reference
- Early chapter drafts before structural changes
- Cut content that might be useful elsewhere

## Organization

### By Chapter
```
archive/
├── Chapter-01/
│   ├── Chapter-01-v1-2025-11-01.md
│   ├── Chapter-01-v2-2025-11-15.md
│   └── Chapter-01-alternative-opening.md
├── Chapter-02/
└── deleted-scenes/
```

### By Date
```
archive/
├── 2025-11-01-Chapter-01-first-draft.md
├── 2025-11-15-Chapter-05-pre-revision.md
└── deleted-scenes/
```

## When to Archive

- Before major chapter revisions (restructuring, POV changes)
- When cutting significant scenes or content
- After validation fails and major rewrite needed
- When trying alternative approaches
- Before combining or splitting chapters

## Version Naming

Use clear version identifiers:
- `Chapter-05-v1-before-validation.md`
- `Chapter-05-v2-pre-POV-change.md`
- `Chapter-05-deleted-scene-market.md`

## Notes

**Important:** This is separate from 5-text/drafts/:
- **drafts/** = Work in progress, exploratory
- **archive/** = Completed versions being replaced

Keep archives until book is published. Disk space is cheap, lost writing is tragic.
