# 1-ideation/

**Pipeline Phase:** 1 of 9
**Purpose:** Initial concept development, framework ideas, story brainstorming

---

## 📋 Overview

This is where your book begins—raw ideas, initial concepts, character sketches, and framework development. Everything here is exploratory and generative.

**Phase goal:** Develop the core concept before formal research and documentation.

## 📂 What Goes Here

### Framework Development
- Core framework or system concepts
- Theoretical foundations
- Conceptual models
- Philosophical underpinnings

### Story Elements (for fiction/narrative)
- Story arc brainstorming
- Character development sketches
- Setting exploration notes
- Conflict and tension ideas
- Thematic elements

### Market Positioning
- Target audience ideas
- Competitive positioning thoughts
- Unique value proposition drafts
- Genre exploration

### Early Research
- Preliminary topic exploration
- Initial reading lists
- Quick market scans
- Feasibility assessments

## 🎯 Activities in This Phase

1. **Brainstorming** - Free-form idea generation
2. **Conceptualizing** - Developing core concepts
3. **Sketching** - Rough outlines of characters, plot, themes
4. **Exploring** - Initial research and reading
5. **Positioning** - Market and audience thinking

---

## ✅ Phase Completion Criteria

This phase is complete when you have:
- [ ] Clear core concept or framework
- [ ] Rough character/story sketches (if fiction)
- [ ] Understanding of target audience
- [ ] Initial unique value proposition
- [ ] Enough clarity to proceed to formal research

**No need for perfection—just enough to move forward.**

## 🔄 Workflow

### Phase Start
1. Create brainstorming documents
2. Capture all ideas without filtering
3. Explore related concepts freely

### During Phase
1. Refine concepts that resonate
2. Sketch out characters/themes/arguments
3. Begin identifying gaps to research

### Phase End
1. Consolidate key concepts
2. Create initial framework summary
3. Generate research questions for Phase 2
4. Update [../metrics/trackers/IDEATION-PHASE-TRACKER.md](../metrics/trackers/IDEATION-PHASE-TRACKER.md)

## 🔗 Next Phase

Once ideation is complete, proceed to:
**[2-research/](../2-research/)** - Literature review, market analysis, formal research

Key transition: Ideas → Evidence

---

## 📊 Metrics to Track

- Number of concept documents
- Word count of ideation notes
- Character sketches completed
- Key themes identified
- Research questions generated

## 💡 Tips

1. **Don't self-edit** - Capture everything, filter later
2. **Explore broadly** - Adjacent ideas often spark the best concepts
3. **Sketch quickly** - Details come later in prep phase
4. **Stay curious** - Follow interesting threads
5. **Document inspirations** - Capture what sparks ideas

---

**This phase is about possibility and exploration. Give yourself permission to explore freely.**
