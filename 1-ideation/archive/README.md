## When to Archive

- When concept documents are significantly revised
- When ideas are abandoned but worth keeping for reference
- When consolidating multiple early docs into one refined version
- Monthly cleanup of outdated brainstorming files

## Notes

Keep the parent ideation folder clean—move old material here regularly. Archive is searchable history, not clutter.

**Phase-specific archive: Keeps ideation folder focused on current concepts.**
