# 4-utilities/

**Pipeline Phase:** 4 of 9
**Purpose:** Tools, templates, snippets, and prompts for production efficiency

---

## 📋 Overview

This phase creates reusable assets that accelerate production. Instead of recreating similar content repeatedly, you build a library of tools, templates, snippets, and prompts that streamline your workflow.

**Phase goal:** Build a utilities library that speeds up phases 5-9.

## 🎯 Best Practices

1. **Build as you go** - Create utilities when you need them twice
2. **Document thoroughly** - Future you will forget how to use them
3. **Keep organized** - Clear folder structure and naming
4. **Test extensively** - Broken tools waste more time than they save
5. **Version control** - Track changes to utilities
6. **Share templates** - Consider making some public/open source

## 💡 When to Create Utilities

### Create when you:
- Do the same task 3+ times
- Find yourself copying/pasting repeatedly
- Need consistent formatting
- Want to automate validation
- Use AI assistance regularly

### Don't over-engineer:
- One-off tasks don't need tools
- Simple manual work is often faster
- Complex tools can be maintenance burdens
