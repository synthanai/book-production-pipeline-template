## 🎯 When to Create Snippets

### Create snippet if:
- Description appears 3+ times
- Consistency is critical
- Complex description is hard to recreate
- Standard phrasing exists
- Quick insertion would save time

### Don't snippet:
- Unique, one-time descriptions
- Highly contextual content
- Creative variations desired
- Simple, obvious phrases

| **Use** | Insert into writing | Check for accuracy |
| **Length** | Sentences/paragraphs | Single facts |
