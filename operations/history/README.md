## 🎯 Usage Guidelines

### What Belongs Here

- **Not archival** - Not ready for long-term storage yet
- **Recent history** - Last 1-3 months typically

### What Doesn't Belong Here
- **Current work** - Belongs in [../current/](../current/)
- **Long-term archive** - Should go to [../../archive/](../../archive/)
- **Validation reports** - Stay in [../validation/](../validation/)
- **Final reports** - Stay in [../report/](../report/)
