## 🎯 Example Decision: Gate Waiver

### Decision: Skip Pass 1 Validation for Acts III-IV

**Date:** 2025-11-05
**Phase:** 5 (Text Production)
**Gate Affected:** Phase 5 mid-point quality gate
**Decision Maker:** Author
**Decision Type:** ⏸ WAIVER (criteria partially skipped)

#### Context
- Acts I-II completed full Pass 1 validation (148-dimension quality check)
- Pass 2 NQ validation showed excellent quality (4.86/5.0 average across all acts)
- Timeline pressure to move toward publication
- Diminishing returns observed on Pass 1 for later acts given Pass 2 scores

#### Criteria Evaluated
✅ **Pass 2 NQ scores ≥ 4.5/5.0** - All Acts III-IV chapters exceeded threshold
✅ **Consistent with Acts I-II quality** - No drop in narrative quality observed
✅ **No major inconsistencies flagged** - Character/plot continuity maintained
⏸ **Pass 1 validation provides additional depth** - WAIVED (would add 20+ hours)

#### Decision Rationale
**WAIVE Pass 1 validation for Acts III-IV. Proceed directly to Pass 2 NQ validation.**

**Reasoning:**
1. Pass 2 NQ already validates 8 critical narrative dimensions
2. Acts III-IV scored 4.8+ (higher than Acts I-II baseline)
3. Pass 1 adds granular detail but limited incremental value given high Pass 2 scores
4. Time investment (20+ hours) not justified by marginal quality gain
5. Final copyedit will catch remaining issues before publication

#### Risks Accepted
- **Potential missed issues** that Pass 1's 148-dimension check would catch
- **Less detailed quality documentation** for Acts III-IV compared to Acts I-II
- **Reduced confidence** in granular quality metrics (mitigated by high Pass 2 scores)

#### Mitigation Strategy
1. ✅ Maintain Pass 2 NQ validation (non-negotiable)
2. ✅ Set minimum Pass 2 threshold at 4.5/5.0 (above baseline)
3. ✅ Conduct final copyedit to catch any issues Pass 1 would have found
4. ⏸ Option to revisit Pass 1 if any Pass 2 scores drop below 4.5
5. ⏸ Option to conduct selective Pass 1 on any flagged chapters

#### Alternatives Considered
1. **Full Pass 1 validation** (rejected: 20+ hours, diminishing returns)
2. **Selective Pass 1 on lowest-scoring chapters** (rejected: added complexity)
3. **No validation at all** (rejected: too risky, no quality baseline)
4. **Abbreviated Pass 1 (50 dimensions)** (rejected: still 10+ hours, unclear value)

#### Result
✅ **Decision validated:** Acts III-IV passed Pass 2 NQ with 4.8+ average scores
✅ **Quality maintained:** No drop in narrative quality observed
✅ **Timeline improved:** Saved 20+ hours, accelerated to publication phase
✅ **Risk mitigation successful:** Final copyedit caught minor issues, no major problems

**Lessons Learned:**
- High Pass 2 scores (4.8+) are strong indicators of quality
- Pass 1 provides diminishing returns when Pass 2 scores are consistently high
- Gate waivers should be data-driven (use metrics to justify decisions)
- Document waivers thoroughly for future reference and project retrospectives
