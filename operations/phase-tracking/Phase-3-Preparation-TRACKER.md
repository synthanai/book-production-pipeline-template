## 💡 Tips for This Phase

**Do:**
- ✅ Invest time here (saves time during writing)
- ✅ Use AI heavily for initial drafts
- ✅ Ensure all documents are consistent
- ✅ Create detailed chapter outline (critical)
- ✅ Validate preparation with beta readers or writing partners

**Don't:**
- ❌ Skip chapter outline (causes structure problems)
- ❌ Over-prepare (diminishing returns after a point)
- ❌ Treat prep docs as final (they'll evolve during writing)
- ❌ Forget to document quality standards
- ❌ Start writing too early (weak foundation = rewrites)

**How much preparation is enough?**
- **Minimal:** 10,000-20,000 words (character sketches, basic outline)
- **Standard:** 50,000-100,000 words (detailed profiles, chapter outlines, research)
- **Extensive:** 100,000+ words (deep world-building, frameworks, comprehensive research)
