## 💡 Lessons Learned (SYNTHAI Example)

**What Worked:**
- ✅ Extensive preparation (1.4M words of prep docs) enabled faster writing
- ✅ AI-assisted writing with human oversight produced high-quality prose
- ✅ Pass 2 NQ validation (8 dimensions) sufficient for quality assurance
- ✅ Waiving Pass 1 for Acts III-IV saved 20+ hours without quality drop
- ✅ Iterative refinement based on validation feedback improved consistency

**What Could Be Improved:**
- ⚠️ Should have done copyedit concurrently with final chapters (not batched at end)
- ⚠️ Could have formatted for narration chapter-by-chapter (easier than batch)
- ⚠️ Pass 1 validation (148D) provided diminishing returns for high-scoring content

**Time Investment:**
- Writing: ~160 hours
- Validation: ~20 hours
- Refinement: ~10 hours
- **Total: ~190 hours** (0.46 hours/page or 2.17 pages/hour)

**Quality ROI:**
- Preparation investment paid off: Minimal rewrites needed
- AI assistance accelerated writing 3-5x vs. manual writing
- Validation caught issues early, reducing late-stage revisions
