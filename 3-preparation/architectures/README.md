**Tier:** 2 (Structural Specifications)
**Purpose:** Framework specifications and structural architectures

---

## 📋 Overview

Architecture documents define the structural frameworks, systems, and patterns that organize your book. They specify HOW concepts are organized and HOW systems interact.

**Authority:** Tier 2 - Structural

---

## 📂 Typical Contents

### Framework Specifications
- Core framework architecture
- System components and interactions
- Conceptual models
- Theoretical foundations
- Pattern specifications

### Organizational Dynamics
- How systems evolve
- Interaction patterns
- Change mechanisms
- Feedback loops
- Transformation processes

### Narrative Architecture
- Story structure specifications
- Act structure and pacing
- Chapter organization patterns
- Scene sequencing rules
- Narrative progression model

---

## 📊 Characteristics

### Structural
- Defines organization and relationships
- Specifies patterns and systems
- Creates reusable frameworks
- Establishes architectural principles

### Systematic
- Logical and consistent
- Interconnected components
- Clear dependencies
- Formal specifications

### Foundational
- Referenced by blueprints and guides
- Implements master document concepts
- Supports consistent execution

---

## ✅ Creation Checklist

For each architecture document:
- [ ] Clear purpose and scope
- [ ] System components defined
- [ ] Interactions specified
- [ ] Patterns documented
- [ ] Diagrams or visual models (if applicable)
- [ ] Cross-references to masters
- [ ] Examples of application
- [ ] Consistency with other architectures

## 🔄 Relationship to Other Docs

### Implements Masters
Architecture documents take concepts from masters and specify their structure:
- Master World Guide → Architecture of world systems
- Master Story Blueprint → Architecture of narrative structure
- Master Character Guide → Architecture of character development

### Informs Blueprints
Blueprints apply architectures to specific sections:
- Architecture-Narrative-Structure → Act I Blueprint
- Architecture-Framework-Specs → Chapter implementation

### Guides Execution
Guides reference architectures for standards:
- Architecture specs → Writing guides
- System specifications → Scene construction guides

## 🎯 Best Practices

1. **Be systematic** - Architectures should be logical and consistent
2. **Use diagrams** - Visual models clarify complex systems
3. **Define relationships** - Specify how components interact
4. **Stay abstract** - Details belong in blueprints/guides
5. **Cross-validate** - Ensure architectures don't conflict
6. **Think reusable** - Patterns should apply broadly

## 💡 When to Create Architectures

### Create if you have:
- Complex frameworks or systems
- Multiple interconnected components
- Patterns that repeat throughout book
- Theoretical models to specify
- Organizational structures to define

### Skip if:
- Simple, linear narrative
- No complex systems
- Minimal world-building
- Personal/memoir writing

---

## 📊 Typical Size

- 30,000 - 100,000 words per document
- 2-5 architecture documents per project
- More technical/systematic than guides
- Less comprehensive than masters
