# 3-preparation/

**Pipeline Phase:** 3 of 9
**Purpose:** All documentation before writing—world-building, standards, frameworks

---

## 📋 Overview

This is the most comprehensive phase for many projects. Here you create all the detailed preparation documents that will guide your writing. This phase transforms research (Phase 2) into actionable documentation.

**Phase goal:** Create complete documentation so writing can flow without constant stopping to figure things out.

## 📂 Directory Structure

### Tier 1: Foundation Documents
**[masters/](masters/)** - Master documents (highest authority)
- Master Story Blueprint
- Master Character Guide
- Master World Guide

### Tier 2: Structural Specifications
**[architectures/](architectures/)** - Architectural frameworks
- Framework specifications
- Organizational dynamics
- Narrative structure

**[blueprints/](blueprints/)** - Act-level blueprints
- Act I Blueprint
- Act II Blueprint
- Act III Blueprint
- Act IV Blueprint

### Tier 3: Execution Guides
**[guides/](guides/)** - Writing guides and standards
- Writing excellence guide
- Character portrayal guide
- Dialogue standards
- Scene construction
- Business implementation guide
- Three-level progression

**[references/](references/)** - Quick lookup documents

## 📊 Document Hierarchy

**Authority levels:**
1. **Masters** - Highest authority, most comprehensive
2. **Architectures & Blueprints** - Structural specifications
3. **Guides** - Detailed how-to documents
4. **References** - Quick lookup tables
5. **Quality Frameworks** - Validation and QA

**When documents conflict:** Higher tier wins.

## 📈 Typical Document Counts

### Large Projects
- 4 Master documents
- 3 Architecture specs
- 10 Writing guides
- 4 Act blueprints
- 3 Reference documents
- 4 Quality frameworks
**Total: ~28 documents, ~1.4M words**

### Medium Projects
- 2-3 Master documents
- 1-2 Architecture specs
- 5-7 Guides
- References as needed
- 2-3 Quality frameworks
**Total: ~12-15 documents, ~500K words**

### Small Projects
- 1 Master document
- 3-5 Guides
- 1-2 References
- 1 Quality framework
**Total: ~6-8 documents, ~100K words**

## ✅ Phase Completion Criteria

This phase is complete when you have:
- [ ] All master documents finalized
- [ ] Architectural frameworks documented
- [ ] Act/section blueprints created
- [ ] Writing guides completed
- [ ] Reference materials prepared
- [ ] Quality frameworks established
- [ ] All documents validated and cross-referenced
- [ ] Everything you need to start writing without constant interruption

## 🔄 Workflow

### Phase Start
1. Review research findings (from Phase 2)
2. Determine document needs for your project
3. Create document outline and hierarchy

### During Phase
1. Write master documents first (foundation)
2. Create architectures and blueprints (structure)
3. Develop detailed guides (execution)
4. Build reference materials (lookup)
5. Establish quality frameworks (validation)
6. Cross-validate all documents

### Phase End
1. Final validation of all prep docs
2. Create master index/table of contents
3. Archive old versions
4. Update [../metrics/trackers/PREP-PHASE-TRACKER.md](../metrics/trackers/PREP-PHASE-TRACKER.md)

---

## 🎯 Best Practices

1. **Start with masters** - Foundation before details
2. **Cross-reference** - Connect related documents
3. **Version control** - Track major changes
4. **Validate thoroughly** - Prep doc errors multiply in writing
5. **Keep updating** - Prep docs evolve as you write
6. **Don't over-prep** - Diminishing returns exist

---

## 🔗 Next Phase

Once preparation is complete, proceed to:
**[4-utilities/](../4-utilities/)** - Tools, templates, snippets, prompts

Key transition: Documentation → Tools

Then eventually:
**[5-text/](../5-text/)** - Actual writing begins

---

## 📊 Metrics to Track

- Documents completed
- Total word count
- Validation status
- Cross-reference completeness
- Time invested per document

Track in: [../metrics/trackers/PREP-PHASE-TRACKER.md](../metrics/trackers/PREP-PHASE-TRACKER.md)

## 💡 When to Skip or Reduce This Phase

### Skip or minimize if:
- Short-form content (articles, essays)
- Highly exploratory writing
- Time-sensitive projects
- Personal journaling

### Go deep if:
- Complex world-building (fantasy, sci-fi)
- Business fiction with frameworks
- Non-fiction with multiple systems
- Series planning (multi-book)
- Detailed historical fiction
