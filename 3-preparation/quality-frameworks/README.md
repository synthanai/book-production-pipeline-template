## 🎯 Best Practices

1. **Define objectively** - Criteria should be measurable
2. **Provide examples** - Show good and poor quality
3. **Create tiers** - Multiple validation passes
4. **Track systematically** - Document all validations
5. **Improve iteratively** - Refine frameworks over time
6. **Reference standards** - Link to guides for criteria

---

## 🔍 Validation Workflow

### Before Writing
1. Review quality frameworks
2. Understand standards
3. Internalize criteria

### During Writing
1. Self-validate while writing
2. Quick checks against checklists
3. Note potential issues

### After Writing
1. Systematic validation (Pass 1)
2. Deep validation (Pass 2)
3. Narrative quality assessment
4. Document results
5. Revise based on findings
6. Re-validate after revisions

## 📊 Quality Metrics to Track

- Validation pass rate (% chapters passing)
- Red items count (serious issues)
- Amber items count (improvement opportunities)
- Revision rate (% requiring major revision)
- Quality trend (improving over time?)
