## 🔄 Relationship to Other Docs

### Implements Masters & Architectures
Blueprints apply high-level specs to specific sections:
- Master Story Blueprint → Act-specific blueprints
- Architecture-Narrative-Structure → Chapter organization
- Master Character Guide → Character arcs per act

### Informs Chapter Writing
Blueprints provide the roadmap for writing:
- Chapter purposes
- Scene requirements
- Plot point placement
- Pacing targets

### Connects to Validation
Blueprints define section-specific validation:
- Did act achieve its purpose?
- Are all plot points present?
- Does pacing match blueprint?

## 💡 When to Create Blueprints

### Create blueprints if:
- Multi-act or multi-part structure
- Complex plot with many threads
- Multiple character arcs to track
- Series or trilogy planning
- Want detailed chapter roadmap

### Skip blueprints if:
- Simple linear narrative
- Short form (articles, essays)
- Exploratory writing style
- Minimal planning preferred

---

## 📊 Typical Size

- 30,000 - 50,000 words per blueprint
- 3-4 blueprints for typical novel structure
- More detailed than architectures for specific section
- Less comprehensive than master story blueprint
