2. **Where does your audience hang out?** (Platforms, communities, events)
3. **What marketing channels will you use?** (Email, social media, ads, podcasts)

5. **How much time can you dedicate?** (5 hours/month, 10 hours/month, 20+ hours/month?)

**Marketing Channel Options:**

## 💡 Tips for This Phase

**Do:**
- ✅ Start building email list EARLY (3-6 months before launch)
- ✅ Focus on 2-3 marketing channels (don't spread too thin)
- ✅ Create content consistently (weekly blog or email newsletter)
- ✅ Engage with readers authentically (build relationships, not just sell)
- ✅ Track metrics (know what's working, double down on winners)

**Don't:**
- ❌ Wait until publication to start marketing (too late)
- ❌ Try every marketing channel at once (burnout + mediocrity)
- ❌ Only promote when you have something to sell (provide value regularly)
- ❌ Ignore metrics (marketing without measurement is guessing)
- ❌ Give up after launch week (marathon, not sprint)

**Common Pitfalls:**
- Waiting until launch to start marketing (missed opportunity)
- No email list (leaving money on the table)
- Inconsistent content (sporadic posting = lost momentum)
- Not tracking metrics (can't optimize what you don't measure)
- Quitting too early (marketing takes 6-12 months to compound)

**Minimum Viable Marketing:**
- Email list (start building 3-6 months pre-launch)
- Author website (simple, professional)
- One social platform (where your audience is)
- Regular content (blog or newsletter, weekly/bi-weekly)
- ARC program (20-50 beta readers for launch reviews)
- **Total time: 10-15 hours/month**
