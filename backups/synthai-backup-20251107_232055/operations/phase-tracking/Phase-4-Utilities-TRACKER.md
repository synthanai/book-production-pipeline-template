## 🤖 AI-Driven vs 🙋 Manual Tasks

### [AI-DRIVEN] Tasks
- [ ] Generate chapter template from prep docs
- [ ] Create AI writing prompts for each chapter type
- [ ] Draft refinement prompts for quality improvement
- [ ] Generate validation prompts for quality checks
- [ ] Create snippet suggestions from genre conventions
- [ ] Draft tool documentation

**Estimated AI Time:** 6-12 hours

---

### [MANUAL] Tasks
- [ ] Test templates with sample chapters
- [ ] Refine AI prompts through trial runs
- [ ] Collect reusable snippets
- [ ] Write automation scripts (if technical)
- [ ] Organize utilities for easy access
- [ ] Validate templates work for your writing style

**Estimated Manual Time:** 4-18 hours

## 📈 Quality Metrics

**Utilities Quality Indicators:**
- [ ] Templates save time (vs. starting from blank page)
- [ ] AI prompts consistently produce quality output
- [ ] Snippets are actually reused (not just collected)
- [ ] Tools work reliably without errors
- [ ] Documentation is clear enough for future you to understand

## 🔗 Dependencies

**Prerequisites:**
- Phase 3 (Preparation) exit gate must pass

**Blocks:**
- Phase 5 (Text Production) cannot start until Phase 4 exits

## 🚧 Current Status & Blockers

**Status:** ⚪ Not Started

**Blockers:** Phase 3 exit gate not passed

**Next Action:** Complete Phase 3 first

## 💡 Tips for This Phase

**Do:**
- ✅ Create templates that match your writing style
- ✅ Test AI prompts before committing to them
- ✅ Keep utilities simple (don't over-engineer)
- ✅ Document how to use each tool
- ✅ Iterate on prompts as you learn what works

**Don't:**
- ❌ Skip this phase (utilities save massive time during writing)
- ❌ Create overly complex templates
- ❌ Collect snippets you'll never use
- ❌ Spend too long perfecting utilities (good enough is good enough)
- ❌ Create tools you won't actually use

**Minimum Viable Utilities:**
- 1 chapter template
- 3-5 core AI prompts (write, refine, validate)
- Basic documentation

You can always add more utilities as you discover needs during writing.
