## 🚧 Current Status & Blockers

**Status:** ⚪ Not Started

**Blockers:** Phase 5 exit gate not passed

**Decision Needed: Publication Strategy**

### Traditional Publishing
**Process:** Query agents → Agent submits to publishers → Publisher acquires book → Publisher handles production/distribution
**Timeline:** 1-3+ years from query to publication
**Pros:** Publisher handles everything, wider distribution, credibility
**Cons:** Very competitive, loss of control, lower royalties (10-15%)
**Best for:** Authors seeking validation, wide bookstore distribution, traditional path

### Self-Publishing
**Process:** Author handles everything → Direct to platforms (Amazon KDP, etc.)
**Timeline:** 2-4 weeks from manuscript to live
**Pros:** Full control, higher royalties (35-70%), fast timeline
**Cons:** Author handles everything, harder to get bookstore distribution
**Best for:** Authors wanting control, speed, higher per-sale revenue

### Hybrid Publishing
**Process:** Mix of traditional and self-publishing → Some services outsourced, some DIY
**Timeline:** 1-6 months depending on services
**Pros:** Professional help with key areas, still retain control
**Cons:** Upfront costs ($2K-$10K+), need to vet publishers carefully
**Best for:** Authors wanting professional polish with retained control

**Next Actions:**
1. Decide publication strategy (traditional, self, hybrid)
2. If traditional: Research agents, write query letter, start querying
3. If self: Run `./get-ai-tasks.sh 8` to start publication prep
4. If hybrid: Research hybrid publishers, request quotes

## 💡 Tips for This Phase

**Do:**
- ✅ Invest in professional cover design (most important marketing asset)
- ✅ Order print proof and review carefully before approval
- ✅ Preview ebook on multiple devices
- ✅ Research keywords and categories thoroughly (discoverability)
- ✅ Build pre-launch buzz (email list, social media, ARC readers)

**Don't:**
- ❌ Skimp on cover design (readers judge books by covers)
- ❌ Rush formatting (errors will be permanent and visible)
- ❌ Ignore metadata (keywords/categories critical for discovery)
- ❌ Launch without announcement plan (momentum matters)
- ❌ Publish before you're ready (you can't unpublish)

**Common Pitfalls:**
- Amateur-looking cover (instant turn-off for readers)
- Typos in book description or metadata
- Poor ebook formatting (unreadable on devices)
- Wrong categories (book won't be discovered)
- No launch plan (book goes live to silence)
