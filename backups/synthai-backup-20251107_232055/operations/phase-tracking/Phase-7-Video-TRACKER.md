## 🚧 Current Status & Blockers

**Status:** ⚪ Not Started

**Blockers:** Phase 5 exit gate not passed

**Decision Needed: Video Strategy**

**Do you want to create videos?**
- **If YES:** What types? (Trailer, author intro, chapter previews, course?)
- **If NO:** Skip Phase 7, proceed to Phase 8 (Publication)
- **If LATER:** Skip Phase 7 now, add videos post-publication

**Factors to Consider:**
- **Platform presence:** Do you have YouTube/social media presence?
- **Comfort on camera:** Are you comfortable being on video?
- **Time investment:** Video production is time-consuming
- **Marketing value:** Videos can drive significant engagement
- **Budget:** Can outsource video production ($500-$5,000+ per video)

**Next Action:** Decide video strategy, then run `./get-ai-tasks.sh 7` if proceeding

## 💡 Tips for This Phase

**Do:**
- ✅ Start with simple videos (author intro, book pitch) before complex productions
- ✅ Invest in decent microphone (audio quality matters more than video quality)
- ✅ Use good lighting (natural light or ring light)
- ✅ Keep videos concise (attention spans are short)
- ✅ Batch filming (film multiple videos in one session)

**Don't:**
- ❌ Obsess over perfection (done is better than perfect)
- ❌ Create videos you'll never publish (finish and ship)
- ❌ Ignore platform-specific formats (vertical for Instagram/TikTok)
- ❌ Forget SEO (titles, descriptions, keywords matter)
- ❌ Skip thumbnails (they drive clicks)

**Common Pitfalls:**
- Over-producing (spending weeks on a single video)
- Poor audio quality (audience will leave immediately)
- Videos too long (trim ruthlessly)
- Not optimizing for each platform
- Creating videos without distribution plan

**Minimum Viable Video Strategy:**
- 1 book trailer (1-2 minutes)
- 1 author introduction (2-3 minutes)
- 3-5 chapter preview clips (30-60 seconds each)
- **Total time: ~20-30 hours**
