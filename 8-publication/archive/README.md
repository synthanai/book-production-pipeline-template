## When to Archive

- Before generating new publication files
- When cover design changes
- After significant content updates requiring republishing
- When metadata or ISBN information changes
- Before uploading new versions to distribution platforms

## Version Control

Critical for publication files:
- Include version number and date
- Keep notes on what changed between versions
- Track which version is live on each platform

## Platform Tracking

Document which version is published where:
