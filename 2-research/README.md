## 🔗 Next Phase

Once research is complete, proceed to:
**[3-preparation/](../3-preparation/)** - Detailed documentation before writing

Key transition: Research → Documentation

---

## 📊 Metrics to Track

- Sources reviewed (count)
- Comp titles analyzed
- Research documents created
- Word count of research notes
- Expert consultations conducted

Track in: [../metrics/trackers/RESEARCH-PHASE-TRACKER.md](../metrics/trackers/RESEARCH-PHASE-TRACKER.md)

## 💡 Tips

1. **Go deep** - Surface research shows in shallow writing
2. **Track sources** - You'll need them for citations and verification
3. **Look for gaps** - Gaps are opportunities for differentiation
4. **Stay organized** - Research can quickly become overwhelming
5. **Synthesize early** - Don't just collect, analyze and connect
6. **Know when to stop** - Research can be procrastination in disguise

---

## 🔍 Research Tools

Helpful tools for this phase:
- Reference managers (Zotero, Mendeley)
- Note-taking apps (Notion, Obsidian, Evernote)
- Spreadsheets for comp title analysis
- Market research databases
- Library access for academic sources
